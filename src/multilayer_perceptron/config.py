    "The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset is a collection of features computed from "
    "a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset contains "
    "diagnostic information for breast cancer patients, including features such as radius, "
    "texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness of the cell nuclei."
